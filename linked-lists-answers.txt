1. What are some Pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

PROS: Each node is independent in memory, so OS may use available memory location to store it. Mode memory independence allows linked list to grow to immense sizes. Large arrays or inserting new elements into an array require OS to rearrange physical memory space to make room for them, which is expensive.


CONS: Since data is not stored contiguously, it can be inefficient to access an element within the list. Arrays are indexed, so accessing desired element is easier.

2.Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

Driving to different gas stations to see if they have your favorite ice cream.


Programming questions


1. Fix the bug/code.

LinkedList.prototype.push = function(element) {
 SET node = {
   value: element,
   next: head node
 }

 IF the head node does not exist
   THEN SET head to node
 ELSE
   SET current node to head
   SET current.next to node
 }
}



2. Remove all duplicated from the linked list.

Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d





3. Reverse it.

Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a
