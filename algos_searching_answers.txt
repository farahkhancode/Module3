1.What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A:   A n example of a linear or sequential search is if you have a stack of unsorted books and you check each cover to see if its the one you are looking for.


2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A:   A real life scenario of a binary search is when we use a dictionary. You can start by opening the dictionary in the middle and eliminating sides to get to your definition based on he spelling of the word



3.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A:  7 iterations



4.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3 iterations


5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: If it is unsorted, a linear search would be the best method since you have to check each one as there is no order.



6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: If the items are sorted, I would use a binary search since I we can estimate where the item to be found lies by dividing the collection and checking if the item is larges or smaller than the midpoint.



Programming Assignment:
1.You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


Binary search 
FUNCTION binarySearch(dictionary, word){
 var albatross = word.split('');
 var low = dictionary[0];
 var high = dictionary[25];
 var mid = (low + high)/2
 while low <=high{
    for (var i=0; i<albatross.length; i++{
        if(dictionary[mid] > albatross[i]){
        high = mid -1;
        }
        else if(dictionary[mid] < albatross[i]){
        low = mid+1;
        }
        else{
        return mid;
        }
      }
     return "Not Found";
   }
 } 


2.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.


linear search

var linearSearch = function(allFish, whiteSpot) {
   var result = null, value;
   for(var i = 0; i < allFish.length; i++) {
     value = allFish[i];
     if(value === whiteSpot){
       result = i;
       break;
     }
   }
   return result;
 };
