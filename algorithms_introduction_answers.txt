Questions:



1.Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee:


FUNCTION
For water in kettle, INCREMENT water until kettle is equal to 1 cup THEN
  IF water in kettle is equal to 1 cup, SET kettle to TRUE THEN
    WHILE kettle is true, INCREMENT temp to 100 degrees C.
    END WHILE
  END IF 
END FOR

IF temp is equal to 100 degrees C THEN 
   cup + coffee + water + sugar
   stir
END IF

END FUNCTION



Washing dishes:


IF Dishes in sink greater than 0
  SET dirtyDishes to true
 ELSE SET dirtyDishes to false


FUNCTION
 IF dirtyDishes is false
    PRINT "No dishes to wash"
 END IF
   ELSEIF dirtyDishes is true
      add soap and water to sink, scrub dishes, remove dishes from sink
   END ELSE IF

END FUNCTION




Sorting laundry:


IF laundryItems greater than 0
  SET laundryItems to true
 ELSE SET laundryItems to false

FUNCTION
 IF laundryItems is false
    PRINT "No laundry to fold"
 END IF
   ELSEIF laundryItems is true
      sort laundryItems, fold laundryItems, store laundryItems
   END ELSE IF

END FUNCTION




2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Facebook has algorithms to show you relevant adds suited to your interests based on searches you perform.

Tile uses algorithms and is a product that you stick on important items and it helps track things you lost by sending a signal to your phone.

Amazon Echo uses algorithms and allows you to ask many things without having to pull out your phone.

3.Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

An efficient algorithm takes logical steps towards completing a task in an efficient manner and in a finite amount of time.
