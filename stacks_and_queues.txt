1. What s the main difference between stack and queue?

>A: Queue data structure arranges elements in FIFO(First In First Out) priority while stack data structure arranges elements in LIFO(Last In First Out) priority.


2. What are the similarities between stack and queues?

>A:They are both data structures that and operate in a linear fashion where data can be arranges from the first or last element, not in between.


3.Which data structures would you use for implementing UNDO and REDO?

>A: UNDO  would use the stack data structure as you want the last action to be the first to go(LIFO). REDO would also use stack because you would want the last action to be repeated(LIFO).

  INIT reversed to empty string
  WHILE stack is not empty
    CALL stack.pop RETURNING character
    APPEND character to reversed
  END WHILE
  RETURN reversed
END FUNCTION
