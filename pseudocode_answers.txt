1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Answer: Pseudocode is used to help programmers plan out their code before  writing it in programming language. It is a way to organize parts and brainstorm  prior to writing the code that the computer will read.


2. If you run pseudocode what would happen?
Answer: You would probably get an error message because computers cannot read pseudocode.



PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT


1. INPUT first number
   INPUT second number
   Call the reduce method with Math.max and store the result in largest
   return largest



2.SET number to 100
  WHILE number is less that or equal to 100 and greater than 0
  PRINT number
  decrement number by 1
  ENDWHILE


3. SET string to entry 
   SET array to phonebook
 START FUNCTION and use entry and phonebook as parameters
 FOR beginning to length of phonebook check each next item
    IF phonebook includes entry
       Call the includes method on phonebook with entry as parameter
  return true
    END IF
       ELSE return false
       END ELSE
 END FOR
 END FUNCTION

4.  IMPLEMENT INTO CODE


    str = "farah"
    phonebook =["farah", "mina", "john"]
 
 
 
 function isInPhonebook(str, phonebook){
 for(var i=0; i<phonebook.length; i++){
   if (phonebook.includes(str)){
     return true;
   }else{
     return false;
   } 
 }
 }
 
 isInPhonebook(str,phonebook);
